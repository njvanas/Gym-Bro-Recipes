                            The maintenance phase is about sustaining your current physique while preserving muscle mass and strength. 
                            This phase requires a balanced approach to nutrition and training. This guide covers the complete approach 
                            I used during my maintenance phase, including training routines, nutrition strategies, recipes, and daily schedules.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The maintenance phase is often overlooked but is crucial for long-term success. It allows your body to adapt 
                            to your current physique and provides a stable foundation for future cutting or bulking phases. This phase 
                            can be maintained indefinitely and provides a sustainable approach to fitness.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Phase Duration:</strong> Maintenance phases are recommended to last <strong>3 months</strong> between 
                            bulking and cutting phases. This duration allows your body to become fully acquainted with its new form, reduces 
                            metabolic stress, and helps solidify new habits. The 3-month maintenance period prevents you from easily falling 
                            back into old patterns and gives your organs and systems time to recover from the demands of bulking or cutting. 
                            This cycle of 3-month bulk → 3-month maintenance → 3-month cut → 3-month maintenance creates a sustainable, 
                            long-term approach to bodybuilding that minimizes strain on your body.

                            Training during maintenance should focus on preserving strength and muscle mass. The volume and intensity 
                            can be adjusted to maintain your current level of fitness without the stress of cutting or the demands of bulking. 
                            Below is the training routine I followed during this maintenance phase.

                            <strong>Training Approach:</strong> The training routine during maintenance balanced volume and intensity 
                            to maintain current strength and muscle mass. This phase allowed for more flexibility in training schedule 
                            and recovery, making it more sustainable long-term compared to cutting or bulking phases.

                            During the maintenance phase, caloric intake should match your total daily energy expenditure (TDEE).
