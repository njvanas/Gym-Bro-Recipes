                            The cutting phase focuses on reducing body fat while preserving as much muscle mass as possible. 
                            This requires a caloric deficit combined with strategic training and nutrition. This guide covers 
                            the complete approach I used during my cutting phase, including training routines, nutrition strategies, 
                            recipes, and daily schedules.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Cutting requires patience and consistency. Rapid weight loss can lead to muscle loss. 
                            Aim for a gradual reduction of 0.5-1% of body weight per week. Monitor your progress 
                            and adjust your approach based on how your body responds.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Phase Duration:</strong> This cutting phase is designed to last <strong>3 months</strong> to minimize 
                            strain on the body and organs. Extended cutting phases can be metabolically stressful, so limiting to 3 months 
                            helps preserve metabolic health. After completing a 3-month cut, transition into a <strong>3-month maintenance 
                            phase</strong> to allow your body to stabilize, become acquainted with its new form, and prevent you from easily 
                            falling out of your new habits. This cycle helps maintain long-term sustainability.

                            During cutting, training should maintain intensity while potentially adjusting volume. 
                            The focus is on preserving strength and muscle mass despite being in a caloric deficit. 
                            Below is the training routine I followed during this cutting phase.

                            <strong>Training Approach:</strong> The training routine during cutting was adjusted to maintain 
                            intensity while being mindful of recovery. Volume was slightly reduced compared to bulking, 
                            but intensity remained high to preserve muscle mass. Cardio was incorporated strategically 
                            to support the caloric deficit without interfering with recovery.

                            During the cutting phase, I created a caloric deficit of 300-500 calories below my TDEE.

                            throughout the day. Carbohydrates were prioritized around training sessions. High-volume, 
                            low-calorie vegetables were included in most meals to increase satiety.
